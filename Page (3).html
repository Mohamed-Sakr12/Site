<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>Database storage is the container of the physical materialization of a database. It comprises the internal (physical) level in the database architecture. </p>
<p>It also contains all the information needed (e.g., metadata, "data about the data", and internal data structures) to reconstruct the conceptual level and external level from the internal level when needed. Putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of the database engine a.k.a. </p>
<p>"storage engine". Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often using the operating systems' file systems as intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration setting are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators. </p>
<p>A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, </p>
<p>are coded into bits. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look in the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels' reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database). </p>
<p>Some DBMSs support specifying which character encoding was used to store data, so multiple encodings can be used in the same database. </p>
<p>Various low-level database storage structures are used by the storage engine to serialize the data model so it can be written to the medium of choice. Techniques such as indexing may be used to improve performance. </p>
<p>Conventional storage is row-oriented, but there are also column-oriented and correlation databases. </p>
